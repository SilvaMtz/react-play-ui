`npm install react-play-ui`

## Local Playground
#### 1. Fork or download the repository
#### 2. Inside the project folder (root), run the following lines:
```
npm run i-all
```
This command will run package installation in the library and the docs (playground) directory.
```
npm run dev
```
This will run `npm start` on both directories with a `--watch` arg, so it can listen to changes in the component library.
